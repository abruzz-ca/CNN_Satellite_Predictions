# CNN_Satellite_Predictions
Using CNN to classify whether a ship is present in a satellite photo. Goal: In this notebook, you will need to create a model in TensorFlow/Keras using Convolutional layers to classify satellite photos.  The features are images: 3 dimensional collection of pixels 2 spatial dimensions 1 dimension with 3 features for different parts of the color spectrum: Red, Green, Blue The labels are either 1 (ship is present) or 0 (ship is not present) Unlike the model we created in the previous assignment (using Dense/Fully Connected layers) we will retain all three color channels of the data rather than converting it to one channel gray scale.
